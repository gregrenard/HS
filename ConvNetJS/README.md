# Deep Learning Introduction with ConvNetJS at Hoberton School

Deep Learning Introduction by Louis Monier and Gregory Renard.

## Introduction

The goals of this exercices are 
- to play with your first Neural Networks based on the famous Javascript implementation of Neural networks by Andrej Karpathy : "ConvNetJS".
- to develop your intuition about Neural Network and observe how hyper-paramaters impact the learning curve.

ConvNetJS is a Javascript library for training Deep Learning models (mainly Neural Networks) entirely in your browser. 
Open a tab and you're training. No software requirements, no compilers, no installations, no GPUs, no sweat

ConvNetJS is a Javascript implementation of Neural networks, together with nice browser-based demos.
ConvNetJs is developed by Karpathy.  The original project : https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs
